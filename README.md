# Digital Signal Processing Assignment

The project holds the solution to the DSP Assignment of 2019 at Cranfield University. This assignment tests the understanding of discrete-time signals, frequency analysis, power spectrum density analysis, digital filter design and modelling of real world data using DSP techniques.

# Usage

Each of the files are independent to the question with the exception of utility functions for reading from files.

# Case study results

The autocorrelation of nao results in nothing and this suggests that NAO might be closer to white noise.

# Maintenance

This project will not be maintained past the submission of the assignment on **_6<sup>th</sup> January 2020_**.
